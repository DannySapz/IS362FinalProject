# IS362FinalProject


At a high level, this final project is supposed to display everything we've learned throughout the course, along with displaying our abilities to also learn new information outside of this course. 
Therefore, what I am seeking to accomplish is a way to end this course, fully assured in the fact that I've understood the course material and will move on into the future with all the information 
I've accumulated and using it for further assignments or projects. My motivation for performing this analysis is so I can prove to myself that my anxiety disorder does not control me, nor that I let it interfere with my ability to program. 
Therefore, my motivation for completing this final project is to prove to myself that I am a decent programmer. 


Regarding to what I decided to do for my final project, the professor gave two options that could help. 
I decided to do the "Project â€“ Data Analyst Skills" but instead of data analyst skills and answering the question, 
"Which are the most valued data science skills?" I chose to do it on anime and exploring the top rated and least rated anime based on type, genre, and number of episodes. 
The source data will be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database. I look frward to doing it since I love watching anime in my spare time.
